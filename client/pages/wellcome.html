      <p>Build an application with (preferably with AngularJS) or any other framework you desire.
        You can use the following API as backend:
        <a href="https://angular足api足demo.herokuapp.com/documentation">https://angular足api足demo.herokuapp.com/documentation</a>
        or simply mock the backend part.</p>

      <p>The application is an Order Management System:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>An order should have basic CRUD capabilities (user should be able to create, edit and
          delete an order).</li>
        <li>Every order should have an id, name, weight, destination, creation date, client_id
          (should be selected from a list of clients which is returned from a fake mock API
          endpoint).</li>
        <li>The user should be able to view all orders and sort them by fields.</li>
        <li>The application should have a sticky header with the logged in user name.</li>
        <li>The user should be able to edit his information (email, name, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The design should look similar to the attached:</p>
